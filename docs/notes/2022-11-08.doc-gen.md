Generating Documentation Notes
==============================================================================

Linking
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  In source files (`.py` files) you can use `#<NAME>` and it resolves via the
    local scope. That's actually pretty cool, since it's exactly what I'd want.
    
    Example:
    
    ```python
    from splatlog.rich_handler import RichHandler
    
    def f():
        """Check out #RichHandler when you can."""
        pass
    ```
    
2.  In doc files (`.md` files) that doesn't work; you need to use
    
        {@pylink <FQN>}
        
    Example:
    
    ```
    Check out {@pylink splatlog.rich_handler.RichHandler} when you can.
    ```
    
3.  I'm sure linking to dependencies doesn't work, because... how could it? I
    don't think Python has anything close to an online documentation standard,
    (which is the entire reason I've had to (begrudgingly) spend time on this),
    so where would it go..? Resolvers for each dependency? Can't imagine it
    happening.
    
4.  What does not work, but it would be great if it did, is linking to the
    standard library, since we (somewhat) do know where documentation is at, at
    least on a module-level.
    
    1.  When a link fails to resolve, the complaint is registered from
    
        [pydoc_markdown.novella.preprocessor.CrossrefProcessor.process](
            https://github.com/NiklasRosenstein/pydoc-markdown/blob/b15127e3c643976e71a10c7fa4d03297ee616542/src/pydoc_markdown/contrib/processors/crossref.py#L81
        )
    
    2.  That ends up in
        
        [pydoc_markdown.contrib.renderers.markdown.MarkdownReferenceResolver.resolve_reference](
            https://github.com/NiklasRosenstein/pydoc-markdown/blob/b15127e3c643976e71a10c7fa4d03297ee616542/src/pydoc_markdown/contrib/renderers/markdown.py#L529
        )
        
    3.  Where I think things fail is the `for module in suite` part, since
        anything from stdlib will not be in the suite.
        
        In order to change this, we'd need
        
        1.  A list of what _is_ in stdlib, and to allow resolution against that
            as well. Which seems like it's probably a rabbit hole.
            
        2.  To just assume that an unresolved ref is in stdlib and link it.
